Update run_app.sh to run java server

To update your `run_app.sh` script to run the Java server, you'll need to make sure that your script includes the necessary command to start your Spring Boot application. Below is an example of how you could update the `run_app.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ensure the script stops if there are any errors
set -e

# Set environment variables, if any
# export VARIABLE_NAME=value

# Navigate to the server directory (if necessary)
# cd /path/to/your/spring-boot-project

# Build the project with Maven (ensure `mvn` is installed and available in your PATH)
echo "Building the project..."
mvn clean install

# Run the Spring Boot application
echo "Starting the Spring Boot application..."
java -jar target/your-spring-boot-app.jar

# Note: Replace 'your-spring-boot-app.jar' with the actual name of your jar file
```

### Important Considerations:

1. **Project Structure**: Ensure you navigate to the correct directory where your `pom.xml` or Gradle build file is located before running build commands.

2. **Build Tool**: This script assumes you're using Maven. If you're using Gradle, replace `mvn clean install` with `./gradlew build`.

3. **Jar File Name**: Ensure you replace `your-spring-boot-app.jar` with the actual name of the jar file produced by your build process. You can also set up your build tool to produce a consistent jar file name to simplify this step.

4. **Permissions**: Make sure your script has the appropriate permissions to execute. You can set executable permissions with `chmod +x run_app.sh`.

5. **Environment Variables**: If your application requires any environment variables (like database credentials), make sure to set them up in the script or have them configured in your environment.

6. **Logging**: Consider adding logging to capture the output of the script for easier debugging.

After you make these changes, commit the updated script to your version control system (Git) with a meaningful commit message:

```bash
git add run_app.sh
git commit -m "Update run_app.sh to start the Spring Boot application"
git push origin main
```

This commit message clearly communicates the change you made for future reference.
