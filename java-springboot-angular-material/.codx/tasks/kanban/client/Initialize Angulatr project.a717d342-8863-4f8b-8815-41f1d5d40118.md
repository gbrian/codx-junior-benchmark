To create a new Angular project under the "client" folder, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Node.js and Angular CLI are Installed:**

   First, make sure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your machine. You can check this by running:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ng version
   ```

   If Angular CLI is not installed, you can install it using:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Parent Directory:**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create the "client" folder. For example:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

3. **Create the Angular Project:**

   Use the Angular CLI to create a new project. This will also create the "client" directory:

   ```bash
   ng new client
   ```

   During the setup process, the CLI will ask you some configuration questions. Here are some recommended settings:

   - Choose `Yes` for adding Angular routing if you plan to have multiple pages.
   - Select `SCSS` as the stylesheet format for a more modern styling approach.

4. **Navigate to the Client Directory:**

   Once the project is created, navigate into the "client" directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

5. **Serve the Application:**

   You can serve the new Angular application to verify that it was set up correctly:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

   This will compile the application and start a development server. You can access it by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:4200`.

6. **Version Control:**

   Ensure that your new Angular project is tracked in version control. If the root directory of your project is already a Git repository, add the "client" folder to it:

   ```bash
   git add client
   git commit -m "Add new Angular project in client folder"
   ```

   If you need to initialize a new Git repository, you can do so with:

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initialize repository with Angular project"
   ```

Following these steps, you will have a new Angular project set up under the "client" folder. Make sure to keep your project updated and documented as you make changes.

Can't install ng cli gloablly, no permissions

If you are unable to install the Angular CLI globally due to permission issues, you can install it locally within your project. This way, you can still use the CLI without needing global permissions. Here's how you can proceed:

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**

   Since you want to create the Angular project under a "client" folder, first navigate to the directory where you want this folder to be created.

   ```bash
   cd /home/codxuser/projects/codx-junior-benchmark/java-springboot-angular-material
   ```

2. **Install Angular CLI Locally:**

   You can install Angular CLI as a development dependency within the project:

   ```bash
   mkdir client
   cd client
   npm install @angular/cli --save-dev
   ```

3. **Create a New Angular Project:**

   Use `npx` to run the Angular CLI commands, which will use the locally installed version:

   ```bash
   npx ng new .
   ```

   - Choose `Yes` for adding Angular routing if you plan to have multiple pages.
   - Select `SCSS` as the stylesheet format for a more modern styling approach.

4. **Serve the Angular Application:**

   You can now serve the application locally using:

   ```bash
   npx ng serve
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to see your application running.

5. **Update Version Control:**

   Ensure the new Angular project is added to your version control:

   ```bash
   git add client
   git commit -m "Add new Angular project in client folder"
   ```

This method allows you to use Angular CLI without requiring global installation permissions, as it leverages the local installation within your project directory.
