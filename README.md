# codx-junior-benchmark

This project serves as a benchmark for codx-junior. It is based on various tests designed to assess performance and features.

## Overview

The benchmark includes different types of projects, each with a set of tasks. Testers will create branches to develop the tasks, and we'll analyze the metrics generated. These metrics include:

- **Code Production**: Comparison of the code generated by codx-junior versus the developer.
- **Code Quality**: Evaluation of the code's maintainability, readability, and adherence to best practices.
- **Development Time**: Time taken by codx-junior versus manual development.
- **Bug Density**: Number of bugs found in the code generated by codx-junior versus the developer.
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by unit tests.
- **Performance Metrics**: Speed and efficiency of the code produced.
- **Resource Utilization**: Memory and CPU usage of the generated code.
- **Scalability**: Ability of the code to handle increased load.
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities and security issues in the code.
- **Documentation Quality**: Clarity and comprehensiveness of the documentation produced.

## Project Types

The benchmark will cover the following types of projects:

1. **Web Applications**: Projects focused on developing web-based interfaces and functionalities.
2. **Mobile Applications**: Development of applications for mobile devices.
3. **APIs**: Creation and management of Application Programming Interfaces.
4. **Data Analysis**: Projects involving data processing and visualization.
5. **Machine Learning**: Implementation of machine learning models and algorithms.
6. **Embedded Systems**: Development for hardware-constrained environments.
7. **Game Development**: Projects focused on creating interactive games.
8. **E-commerce Platforms**: Building online shopping and transaction systems.
9. **DevOps Automation**: Scripts and tools for automating development operations.
10. **Cloud Computing**: Projects involving cloud infrastructure and services.

## Examples

Here is an example of how a typical project branch might be structured:

```
project-name/
│
├── docs/               # Documentation
├── src/                # Source code
│   ├── main/           # Main application code
│   └── test/           # Unit tests
├── .gitignore          # Git ignore file
├── README.md           # Project readme
└── setup.py            # Setup script for the project
```

### Usage Example

To run the benchmark tests, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/codx-junior-benchmark.git
    ```

2. Checkout a new branch for your task:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/task-name
    ```

3. Implement the required functionality and commit your changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Implement task-name"
    ```

4. Push the branch to the repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/task-name
    ```

5. Open a pull request and wait for the metrics analysis.

By maintaining structured and well-documented code, we aim to thoroughly analyze the capabilities and performance of codx-junior in various development scenarios. Please refer to the detailed documentation in the `docs/` directory for more information.
